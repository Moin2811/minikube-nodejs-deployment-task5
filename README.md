# **Kubernetes Task 5 — Minikube Deployment**

## **Objective**

Deploy and manage an application on Kubernetes using **Minikube**, **kubectl**, and **Docker**.

## **Steps Performed**

1. Created a Kubernetes **deployment** (`deployment.yaml`) for **nginx** with **2 replicas**.
2. Created a **NodePort service** (`service.yaml`) to expose the application externally.
3. Verified **pods**, **deployments**, and **services** using `kubectl` commands.
4. Scaled the deployment from **2 to 4 replicas**.
5. Viewed application pod logs and described pod specifications for troubleshooting and inspection.
6. Saved all command outputs in the `outputs/` directory.

## **Repository Contents**

* **`deployment.yaml`** — Deployment configuration.
* **`service.yaml`** — Service configuration.
* **`outputs/`** — Folder containing execution results and command outputs.
